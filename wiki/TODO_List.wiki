----

=== sourcecode ===
  * Make Ids, Tokens & Containers really immutable
  * Remove codesmells
  * Improve comments
  * _Allow an infinite number of input XML files_
  * Handle Exceptions. What if there are no xmls, xmls are empty, etc... Just what ever can go wrong ;)
  * Bundle hardcoded things (eg. properties) in a constants class with final fields
  * Create a token element. This token element serves as building block for the token tree that represents the structure of a raw. Will probably improve the overall quality of the code. Nessesary for Arni's part ,,Arni,,
  * Arni's GUI modding tool. Will be called DwarfStruct :)
  * Build together the tools / Make it switchable
  * Manage existing raws (Read/Write)
