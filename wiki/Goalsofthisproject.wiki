== Power Goals ==
=== Fully user-modifyable syntax highlighting [done] ===
Users will be able to modify the XML database of keywords and add new when DF format changes. Users will be able to modify the color and text decoration scheme via XML css-like configuration.

Each keyword has a type signature which governs how the token is rendered.

=== Autocomplete ===
User will be able to invoke a keystrok which will offer him a list of valid tokens. The list will be dynamicly searched and narrowed as the user type in more letters.

Future features might include learning frequent tags and prioritizing those, as well as some more elaborate patterns.

=== Project browser & tabbed editor enviroment ===
User will be able to browse the project files in the tree-like structure (similar to how most IDEs handle project files). Double-clicking the file will open it on new tab (if not already opened), or center user to the already opened tab. User will be easily able to open and close tabs, rearrange them etc.

=== Smart links ===
User will be able to navigate between RAW files via hyperlinks. The editor will figure out the relations between several RAW files (like body details and creature raws, buildings and reactions etc.) and link these together.
